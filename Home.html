        <p>Welcome to the ASHA Worker Portal!

            This platform is designed to empower ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers by providing an efficient way to manage their profiles, track their work experience, and connect with the community. 
            ASHA workers play a crucial role in improving healthcare at the grassroots level, and our system ensures that their efforts are well-documented and accessible.
           <br>
           <br> 
            With this portal, ASHA workers can register, update their profiles, upload profile pictures, and receive inquiries from people in their area. The user-friendly interface ensures that managing records is simple and efficient.
            <br>
            <br>
            Join us in making healthcare outreach more organized and effectiveâ€”because every ASHA worker deserves recognition and support!
